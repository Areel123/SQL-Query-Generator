# SQL Query Generator

I have made this project called **SQL Query Generator**, a web application developed using Streamlit that allows users to generate SQL queries based on their natural language prompts. By integrating Google Generative AI, the tool dynamically creates SQL queries and provides insights into the expected outputs, along with simple explanations of the queries. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input their queries, and it effectively translates those inputs into structured SQL syntax, making it an essential tool for both beginners and experienced SQL users.

## Features

- Generate SQL queries from natural language prompts.
- Provides expected output examples based on the generated SQL query.
- Offers simple explanations of the generated SQL queries.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **Google Generative AI**: For generating SQL queries based on user input.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in the project.
